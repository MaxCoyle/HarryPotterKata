# Harry Potter Kata

## Write a program to work out the total cost of a basket of Harry Potter books for a book shop

    - 1 book costs £8
    - 2 different books would have a 5% discount, the total cost would be £15.20
    - 3 different books would have a 10% discount, the total cost would be £21.60
    - 4 different books would have a 15% discount, the total cost would be £27.20
    - 5 different books would have a 20% discount, the total cost would be £32.00
    - 6 different books would have a 25% discount
    - 7 different books would have a 30% discount
    - There is no discount for duplicates of the same book, so 2 copies of the same book would be £16.00
    - What would the cost be for these baskets:
    - 3 x The Philosopher's Stone, 2 x The Chamber of Secrets
    - 3 x The Philosopher's Stone, 2 x The Chamber of Secrets, 1x The Prisoner of Azkaban, 4 x The Goblet of Fire
    - 3 x The Philosopher's Stone, 2 x The Chamber of Secrets, 1x The Prisoner of Azkaban, 4 x The Goblet of Fire, 1 x The Order of the Phoenix, 2 x The Half-Blood Prince, 1 x The Deathly Hallows
